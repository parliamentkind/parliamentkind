  <p>The item was removed from Dota 2, because of the imbalance that it brought, at a small cost it gave a lot of impact.</p>

  <p>The whole problem lies in the assembly of this item. It includes Slips of Agility, which give agility, and with it, armor, attack speed and damage.</p>

  <p>However, we can replace them with Ring of Protection, which give armor. Let's compare the 2 assemblies in the table below.</p>

</main>

<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>+ Slips of Agility</td>
  <td>more powerful</td>
  <td>+ Ring of Protection</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>too much impact</td>
  <td>&gt;</td>
  <td>just more armor</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>makes a melee character much more stronger than a rangers</td>
  <td>&gt;</td>
  <td>still, just more armor for comfortable line stage</td>
 </tr>
</table>
